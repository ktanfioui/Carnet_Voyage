# Carnet_Voyage
This is a prototype of a website for a travelling club with a desktop
application for the administrator where he can specify and update the
activities they have in their club, and one web application for the
customer where he can check the club's activities and plan his journey
and make his reservations according to that. I worked on this project
together with two friends.

I uploaded here only The desktop application that i made using the technologies:  Java, JavaFx, MySQL
